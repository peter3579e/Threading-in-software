# Threading-in-software
Ë™The project presents matrix manipulation in the threading process by utilizing pthread library on Linux to discuss the following issues. Firstly, examining the reason why it is highly unlikely that the process of multithreading achieves O(n) performance by using n^2 threads, and the deviation from O(n) performance. Secondly, observing whether the change of thread number will affect the multiplication process. Thirdly, using smaller number of thread (&lt;n^2 ) to see if it still achieves the same performance as n^2. Finally, how the number of physical core and cache size of computer affects the computational performance. Based on the these factors, the limitations and feasibility will be discussed in order to find if the threading system can bring a positive contribution to technologies.
